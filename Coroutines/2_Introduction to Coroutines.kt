Introduction to Coroutines in Kotlin
A Coroutine is a lightweight thread that provides an efficient way to handle asynchronous programming in Kotlin.
Coroutines allow non-blocking execution, making them ideal for running long-running tasks without freezing the main thread.

Unlike traditional threads, coroutines are suspended and resumed without blocking system resources.
