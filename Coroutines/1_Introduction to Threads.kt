A Thread is the smallest unit of execution in a program.
In Kotlin (just like in Java), a thread allows multiple operations to run concurrently, making programs more efficient.


How to Create a Thread and run the Thread.


class Test : Thread(){
    override fun run() {
       super.run()
       println("API calling Executed")
    }
 }
 
 fun main() {
          val test =Test()
          test.start()
 }

Advantages Of Using Thread.

Advantages of Using Threads in Kotlin

Parallel Execution
Threads allow multiple tasks to run simultaneously, improving program efficiency.

Better CPU Utilization
By running multiple threads, CPU cores can be utilized effectively, reducing idle time.

Faster Execution
Tasks that can be performed independently (e.g., file reading, network calls) execute faster when done in separate threads.
Responsive Applications

In GUI applications (like Android), running background tasks in separate threads prevents UI freezing.

Asynchronous Processing
Threads enable non-blocking operations, making applications smoother and more responsive.

Concurrent Task Execution
Allows multiple operations (e.g., downloading files while processing user input) to happen at the same time.

Efficient Multi-User Support
In server applications, threads can handle multiple user requests simultaneously without blocking each other.

Modular Design
Different functionalities can be handled by separate threads, improving code organization and maintainability.
Better Resource Sharing

Threads within the same process share memory space, reducing memory overhead compared to creating separate processes.
Improved Performance in Multi-Core Processors

With modern CPUs having multiple cores, threads enable real parallelism, enhancing application performance.


Limitation of Using Thread in Android.

1. High Memory Consumption
Each thread requires its own stack memory (default ~1MB per thread in Android).
Creating too many threads can lead to OutOfMemoryError (OOM).

2. Thread Management Overhead
The OS must schedule and manage each thread, which increases processing overhead.
More threads mean more context switching, reducing overall efficiency.

3. Increased CPU Load
If too many threads are running simultaneously, the CPU spends more time managing them rather than executing tasks.
This leads to performance degradation instead of improvement.

4. UI Freezing & ANR (Application Not Responding) Errors
If a thread takes too long or too many threads are created, the main (UI) thread can be blocked.
This can cause an ANR (Application Not Responding) issue.

5. Race Conditions & Data Inconsistency
Multiple threads accessing shared resources can lead to race conditions, causing unexpected behavior.
Example: Two threads modifying a variable simultaneously without synchronization.

6. Deadlocks & Synchronization Issues
Threads waiting on each other can lead to a deadlock, causing the app to hang.
Improper synchronization can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes.

7. Limited Thread Pool in Android
Android imposes a limit on thread pools to prevent excessive resource usage.
If too many background threads are created, they may get queued or blocked instead of running immediately.

8. Battery Drain & Poor Power Efficiency
More threads mean more CPU usage, leading to faster battery drain.
This is a critical concern for mobile applications.

9. Hard to Debug & Maintain
Multi-threaded applications are difficult to debug due to concurrency issues.
Finding and fixing thread-related bugs (like race conditions, deadlocks) is challenging.



Solution: Use Alternatives to Threads
âœ… Instead of manually creating multiple threads, Android recommends:

Kotlin Coroutines
 More efficient & structured than threads.

ThreadPoolExecutor
  Manages a fixed number of threads efficiently.

WorkManager Ideal for background tasks.

AsyncTask (Deprecated)
 Was previously used for short background tasks.
